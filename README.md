# FTRL-Kaggle
The code that I used in Click-Through Rate Prediction (http://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/)

The method is described in this paper: http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dsculley/papers/ad-click-prediction.pdf

I rewrited tinrtgu's code from here: http://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/forums/t/10927/beat-the-benchmark-with-less-than-1mb-of-memory

It takes about three hours to process the data with 8 epochs.

Arguments are: 'train file', 'test file', 'submision file'. It should be compiled with -std=c++11.
